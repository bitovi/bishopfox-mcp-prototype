When querying the assets database with the query_assets tool, refer to this schema:

CREATE TABLE tbl_assets (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY, -- Asset ID
    type TEXT NOT NULL, -- Asset type, one of [domain, subdomain, dns_record, ip_address, port, network, service]
    parent_id UUID REFERENCES assets(id), -- Parent Asset ID. Assets follow a hierarchy.
    parent_type TEXT, -- Parent asset type, one of [domain, subdomain, dns_record, ip_address, port, network, service]
    details JSONB NOT NULL -- Asset details (see below)
    tags []TEXT NOT NULL, -- List of user-defined tags to categorize
);

For "domain" type, details contains { 
    "domain": full domain name
    "registrar": name of registrar, e.g., "AWS Route 53", "Namecheap"
    "expiry": unix timestamp of expiration date
}

For "subdomain" type, child of domain, details contains {
    "name": FQDN name of the subdomain (no trailing dot)
}

For "dns_record" type, child of subdomain, details contains {
    "record_type": one of [A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT]. May also include other standard record types.
    "name": dns name
    "value": dns value
    "ttl": in seconds
}

For "ip_address", child of dns_record, details contains {
    "ip": IPv4 or IPv6 formatted address
}

For "port", child of ip_address, details contains {
    "protocol": one of [tcp, udp]
    "reachable": boolean, indicating if the internet can connect to it
    "ip": parent IP address
}

For "network", details contains {
    "cidr": cidr string the network includes
}

For "service" type, child of subdomain or port, details contains {
    "class": one of [ip, hostname], how the service is identified. 
    "hostname": hostname of the service. for 'ip' class, this is an IP address
    "port": port the service listens on
    "protocol": e.g., "https", aka the scheme
    "path": path that the service listens on, e.g., the path part of a URL, including initial "/"
    "ip_list": list of IP addresses linked to this service
    "cpe_list": list of CPEs that the service matches
}

IP services have a Port parent. Hostname services have a Subdomain parent.
