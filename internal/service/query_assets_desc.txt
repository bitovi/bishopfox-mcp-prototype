Query the assets database with SQL. Only SELECT is allowed. This can be used to get information or statistics about assets and answer questions.

Here is the database definition:

CREATE TABLE assets (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- Asset ID
    type TEXT NOT NULL, -- Asset type, one of [domain, service]
    details JSONB NOT NULL -- JSON data with asset details
);

For "domain" type, details contains { 
    "domain": full domain name
    "registrar": name of registrar
    "registrant_organization": name of the organization that registered the domain
    "expiry": unix timestamp of expiration date
}

For "service" type, details contains {
    "hostname": host of the service
    "port": port the service listens on
    "protocol": e.g., "https"
    "path": path that the service listens on (scheme, hostname, port, and path build the full base path for the service)
    "ip_list": list of IP addresses; may be empty for hostname services. if present, the hostname may be empty
    "cdn_name": CDN name (your guess is as good as mine)
    "cdn_type": CDN type (your guess is as good as mine)
    "cpe_list": list of CPEs that the service matches
