Query the assets database with SQL. Only SELECT is allowed. This can be used to get information or statistics about assets and answer questions.

Here is the database definition:

CREATE TABLE assets (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY, -- Asset ID
    type TEXT NOT NULL, -- Asset type, one of [domain, subdomain, dns_record, ip_address, port, network, service]
    parent_id UUID, -- Parent Asset ID
    parent_type, -- Parent asset type, one of [domain, subdomain, dns_record, ip_address, port, network, service]
    details JSONB NOT NULL -- JSON data with asset details
);

Regarding parents, the assets have these parental hierarchies:
domain <- subdomain <- service(class:hostname)
subdomain <- dns_record <- ip_address <- port <- service(class:ip)
network <- ip_address // alternative to dns_record

The 'service' type can have either subdomain or port parent, depending on class

For "domain" type, details contains { 
    "domain": full domain name
    "registrar": name of registrar
    "registrant_organization": name of the organization that registered the domain
    "expiry": unix timestamp of expiration date
}

For "subdomain" type, details contains {
    "hostname": full name of the subdomain
}

For "dns_record" type, details contains {
    "record_type": one of [A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT]. May also include other standard record types.
    "name": dns name
    "value": dns value
    "ttl": in seconds
}

For "ip_address", details contains {
    "ip": IPv4 or IPv6 formatted address
    "location": geolocation country info, e.g., "US"
}

For "port", details contains {
    "protocol": one of [tcp, udp]
    "reachable": boolean, indicating if the the internet can connect to it
    "ip": parent IP address
}

For "network", details contains {
    "cidr": cidr string the network includes
}

For "service" type, details contains {
    "class": 'hostname' or 'ip'; for 'ip' the hostname is a direct IP address
    "hostname": hostname of the service
    "port": port the service listens on
    "protocol": e.g., "https", aka the scheme
    "path": path that the service listens on, e.g., the path part of a URL, including initial "/"
    "ip_list": list of IP addresses linked to this service
    "cpe_list": list of CPEs that the service matches
}
