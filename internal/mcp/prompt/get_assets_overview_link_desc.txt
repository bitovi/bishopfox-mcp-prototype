Returns a URL to the assets overview page with the given parameters.

Typically the user would want to search the asset database for specific assets, but these links can accompany results to help direct the user to the relevant page.

If there is a specific search term from the user, specify it in the search parameter. This is one term only. If it includes spaces, it's searching for an exact string that includes spaces.

Each asset type has different filters that can be used. Multiple filters can be specified.

All asset types include:
- tags: Space separated list of tags to filter by. Don't imply these. The user needs to supply tags if they want this filter.

domain:
- expiry: Filter by remaining expiration days, e.g. "expiry=30" for domains that will expire in 30 days. Specify 0 to show domains that are expired.
- tld: Filter by tld, e.g., "tld=com". Can specify multiple space separated.
