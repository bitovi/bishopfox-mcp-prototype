# Cosmos Documentation

The Cosmos documentation includes non-API information related to Cosmos platform tasks.

Here you'll find information like how to configure Cloud Connectors so that the Cosmos platform can scan your cloud environment for vulnerabilities or how to set up Single Sign On (SSO) for integrating with the Cosmos platform. Over time, this section will grow to include more topics and be the Cosmos centralized content resource.

If you have requests for information you'd like to see here, please contact your Bishop Fox Service Delivery Manager (SDM).
