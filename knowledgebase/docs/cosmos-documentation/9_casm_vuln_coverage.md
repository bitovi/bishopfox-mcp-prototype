| Arbitrary File Deletion             | Arbitrary file deletion occurs when software offers the ability to delete files and makes use of unsanitized user input to determine which files to delete. An attacker can exploit this functionality to delete critical files and cause a denial-of-service condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Arbitrary File Upload               | Arbitrary file upload occurs when software offers the ability to upload files without limiting the upload of executable file formats. An attacker can exploit this functionality to achieve code execution on the vulnerable web server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Broken Access Control               | Access control ensures that users cannot perform actions outside of their intended permissions. Broken access control could allow users to access unauthorized information, modify data, or perform functions that should be restricted to the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Broken Authentication               | Confirming a user’s identity via authentication is critical to properly allowing access to resources. Broken authentication could allow users to access unauthorized information, modify data, or perform unauthorized functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Arbitrary Command Injection         | Arbitrary command injection occurs when a user passes maliciously crafted input into an application, which then uses the unchecked data in a function that executes at the operating system level. As the system cannot differentiate between these malicious commands and regular application commands, the system will execute calls within the authority context of the original application. Command injection vulnerabilities typically occur when: <ul><li>Data enters the application from an untrusted source.</li><li>The data is part of a string that is executed as a command by the application.</li><li>By executing the command, the application gives an attacker a privilege or capability that the attacker would not otherwise have.</li></ul>                                                                                       |
| Command Injection                   | Command injection is an application vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the underlying system. An application that includes untrusted user input into a command string that is executed in a system shell is susceptible to command injection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Default Account Enabled             | Default accounts are those accounts that are built into systems, applications, databases, and embedded devices to provide convenient access prior to the configuration of official accounts. These accounts are prime targets for attackers as they are usually publicly documented and are often overlooked during system deployment and hardening. In many cases, the password associated with a default account is the same as the username or is similarly weak. Online databases of these default account credentials are readily available for malicious users to quickly leverage in their attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Denial Of Service                   | Denial of service (DoS) occurs when an attacker prevents authorized users from accessing a resource. This type of attack arises in three ways. First, it can occur when the transmission medium is disrupted between the user and the resource, leaving no path for communication. Second, the target system may be coaxed to reset, often repeatedly, which forces any established connections to reset as well. Third, the target resource may be fooled into consuming all available computing resources, thereby leaving no available resources to handle legitimate requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Insecure Exposed Web Service        | Insecure exposed web service occurs when a web service used for privileged functionality is exposed to unauthorized parties. This may include access to administrative functionality, exposure of configuration data, detailed debugging information, personal privacy information, proprietary information, or other important data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| File Inclusion                      | Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Local File Inclusion (LFI) are vulnerabilities that are often found in poorly-written web applications. These vulnerabilities occur when a web application allows the user to submit input into files or upload files to the server. LFI vulnerabilities allow an attacker to read (and sometimes execute) files on the victim machine. This can be very dangerous because if the web server is misconfigured and running with high privileges, the attacker may gain access to sensitive information. If the attacker is able to place code on the web server through other means, then they may be able to execute arbitrary commands. RFI vulnerabilities are easier to exploit but less common. Instead of accessing a file on the local machine, the attacker is able to execute code hosted on their own machine. |
| Indicator Of Compromise             | Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are observed artifacts or forensic evidence of a potential intrusion on a system or asset. These indicators can be found in system administration logs, observed through changed or created files, established or listening network connections, or other malicious activity on a system. IoCs allow security researches to identify potential or successful attacks and build out the next steps for incident response and remediation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Sensitive Information Disclosure    | Sensitive information disclosure occurs when private data is exposed to unauthorized parties. This may include financial data, personal privacy information, health records, proprietary information, or other important data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Insecure Network Transmission       | Insecure network transmission occurs when sensitive information is sent over a network without adequate protection. When data is sent across insecure communication channels, it may be susceptible to interception and modification by third parties, resulting in unauthorized information disclosure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Insecure Data Storage               | Insecure data storage refers to a collection of vulnerabilities concerning insufficient or ineffective security controls around the storage of sensitive information. This includes (but is not limited to) lack of data encryption at rest, improper key storage or management, use of weak cryptographic algorithms, and unsafe handling of backups or replication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Insufficient Authorization Controls | Insufficient authorization controls allow an attacker to circumvent intended user- or role-based security mechanisms and access protected resources illegitimately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Open Mail Relay                     | Open relays allow mail to be sent through an application without verifying the sender’s identity. An attacker can misuse this functionality to spoof emails and relay them through the application so that the messages appear to come from a legitimate source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Open Redirection                    | Open redirection vulnerabilities arise when an application incorporates user-controllable data into the target of a redirection in an unsafe way. An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain. This behavior can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Path Traversal                      | A path traversal (or directory traversal) attack occurs when an application fails to properly validate user-supplied input that is used dynamically to access files from the file system. An attacker can retrieve files from the host server by manipulating this input, often a user-controlled path variable such as a filename. This is most commonly done by injecting ../ to navigate out of the current directory to one above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Server-Side Request Forgery         | Server-side request forgery (SSRF) occurs when a server sends a malicious HTTP request on behalf of a user. This vulnerability turns a web application into a proxy, allowing requests to be routed through the application to a destination of the attacker’s choosing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Stale DNS Records                   | When a domain contains subdomains that point to expired domains or unclaimed cloud resources, the subdomains are susceptible to hijacking. By claiming the expired domain or cloud resource, an attacker is able to gain control over the affected subdomain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Abandoned Subdomain Takeover        | When a domain contains subdomains that point to expired domains or unclaimed cloud resources, the subdomains are susceptible to hijacking. By claiming the expired domain or cloud resource, an attacker is able to gain control over the affected subdomain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Vulnerable Configuration            | Vulnerable configuration occurs when a security misconfiguration is made at any level in an application stack. These security misconfigurations can result in information disclosures, exposed services, and other vulnerabilities that could allow a malicious user to gain elevated access to the application itself or its supporting infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Vulnerable Custom Software          | Vulnerable custom software exists when an internally-developed application is found to contain insecure code or security misconfigurations. Insecure software can be affected by a variety of issues, such as arbitrary remote code execution, SQL injection, and other vulnerabilities that could allow a malicious user to gain elevated access to the application itself or its supporting infrastructure. When vulnerabilities are found in custom-built software, remediation typically requires patch development. Unlike vendor-supported software, applications developed in-house cannot usually be protected by installing existing updates.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Vulnerable Software                 | Vulnerable software exists when an application has not been updated with the latest security patches. These insecure versions of software can contain issues such as arbitrary remote code execution, SQL injection, and other vulnerabilities that could allow a malicious user to gain elevated access to the application itself or its supporting infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Weak Cryptography                   | Weak cryptography occurs when an application improperly implements an accepted cryptographic algorithm, uses a custom cryptographic routine, insecurely calls validated cryptographic libraries, uses a weak cryptographic algorithm, uses encoding in place of encryption, or makes calls to cryptographic libraries with known vulnerabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| XML External Entity (XXE) Injection | An XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a target by injecting these commands into an XML document processed by the application. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an XML document with a malicious DOCTYPE containing one or more ENTITY commands. Successful exploitation can result in local file access, access to network resources, or denial-of-service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Severity Level** | **Definition**                                                                                                                                 |
| Critical           | Confirmed vulnerable, exploitation resulted in compromise, and the scope extends beyond the initial compromise or reportable data was obtained |
| High               | Confirmed vulnerable, exploitation resulted in compromise, but the scope is limited and there are no reportable data breaches                  |
| Medium             | Confirmed vulnerable, and the potential for compromise exists, but mitigating factors limit the impact                                         |
| Low                | Confirmed vulnerable, and there are no mitigating factors, but the impact is negligible                                                        |
| Informational      | A non-exploitable notice regarding attack surface hygiene or miscellaneous update                                                              |
